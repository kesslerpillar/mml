# Minimal Marketable Learning
## Building Software Craftsmanship Incrementally
### by David Kessler

Technology is accelkrating at a dizzying pace and we are failing to keep up. This rate of change is stretching young and old alike. The newest app or gadget expands our capabilities and Stretches our imagination. I grew up with a rotary phone feathered to our small town Iowa Kitchen wall Cordless and then cellular phones felt like revolutionary advances in technology. Our first Motorola 2900 bag phone was a two pound brick in a black carrying Case. While it only worked on major highways and large cities it felt like something out of the Twilight Zone. Fast forward and my Cell Phone Shrunk over 80% in size and weight. Not to mention it runs Circles around our first Macintosh Classic It home computer. The combination of phone, video, photo, music, movies, web, apps, gyro, accelerometer, and a growing number
of sensors my phone contains more technology than we could have afforded let alone imagined forty years ago.

As I write the first draft of this learning guide on my iPad Pro@I easily take for granted the ease of jotting down my thoughts with my Apple Pencil@. This ehgant interaction between humanity and technology sets the stage for teaching the next generation. Gone are the years when students were impressed when they printed ' 'Hello World" for the first time. Technology is an accepted and expected part of every day life. This was driven home to me yet again when my 10 year old daughter was shocked that the internet was not free. You'd think our house was on fire when our internet goes down let alone if our connection is spotty. We've come to expect instant results. Google@it or just ask Alexa@. We are impatiently expectant. Instant feedback is expected. The profound paradox is that building these technological extensions of humanity Is slow and incremental. In order to build an app that accepts and stores a person's name on the web requires a sit angering amount of Knowledge. The rate at which we can acquire this type of basic Knowledge is a boulder sized impediment for our industry.

I hacked my way through this boulder initially out of desperation and eventually out of love. It was 1999 and I was folding pants at a department store in St. Louis. My wife and I were pregnant with our first child and minimum wage was barely covering our meager expenses. In order to make ends meet I took a temporary job. My first assignment was updating SAP documentation. This mind numbing job turned me into a human find-and-replace. One of my teammates showed me how to record and modify Microsoft Word@macros. Around the same time, someone at our church had started a software company to meet the rising demand that the YZK bug was creating. I inquired if they might have an opening and they asked me to learn Visual Basic 5 before they would consider my resume. I immediately went out and bought the book "Teach
Yourself Visual Basic 5 in 21 Days." While I never got a job with this startup, I quickly realized that the macros I was editing were VBScript. Desperation for permanent employment fueled my drive to learn.

My next temporary assignment was in a biotech research department. I was asked to Catalog all of our research in an Microsoft Access Database. I quickly became the only team member that Knew how to build SQL queries. These minimal skills landed me a job back in our home state of Iowa. I joined a tech support team at Iowa Student Loan. I quickly found our Microsoft Excel@-based issue tracking system dunks and lacking. I built a Microsoft Access Issue Tracker with forms, reporting and business analytics with SQL and Visual Basic. This achievement inspired my next creation. Our team spent a significant amount of time reading and modifying flat files. This was difficult to learn and error prone. I decided to build a flat file parser withyou guessed it Access, VB, and SQL. These hacks became so vital for our tech support team and management that it presented a support risk for our company. I was an untrained hack that had built business critical applications in my evenings and weekends. As such I had unwittingly put them between a rock and a hard place. They didn't want me to build any more non-supported applications but they also relied heavily on the data and analytics my applications were generating.

This growing tension paired with the mind numbing repetition of my day job brought me to a life altering decision. My real job primarily consisted of support calls and testing our companies first web application. Testing applications by hand was painfully repartitions and error prone. Out of my love for automation I began to record my tests. This began to help but our reports still had to be tested by hand. I was task with verifying the content, layout and formatting. I couldn't find a way to automate PDF reports. With all of the sorting and grouping options a dozen reports multiplied into hundreds of reporting variations. I was sick of testing the same thing over and over. Even if I verified that thousands of things were right for every new release it only took one oversight to draw the ire of our customers and management. These were mission critical reports for financial aid offices all around the state of Iowa and it was on my shoulders to make sure their records were accurate and usable. My rising frustration with my current position motivated me to make a costly gamble. without any guarantee of employment I went back to school for my Master in Software Development and Management. with three Kids we were barely paying all of our bills each month. This only got more complicated when we got pregnan with our second set of twins while I was in grad School. I was working full time, studying thirty hours a week and we were falling behind financially. By the grace of God I was hired as a Junior Software Developer two months before my December graduation.

Honestly I was ill prepared to develop full-stack, enterprise applications. But again I was blessed to be in the right place at the right time. Our department was an early adopter of Agile software development. We drank the Extreme Programming#ool.aid. Even I Knew very little, I was paired up with a senior developer. For XP accelerated peer feedback through pair programming. We paired six hours a day, five days a week, all year long. I recently calculated that I paired in thosefirst years of my career for are ten-thousand hours. This technique coupled with test-driven-development accelerated me from a novice to a seasoned expert in nineshort years.After nearly two decades of developing software, leading teams, hiring and mentoring team members, I've come to realize that we are failing the next generation of Software CDMACC)developers. This realization fully emerged in my mind as the Chair of the Des Moines Area Community College IT Partnership, Application Development Subcommittee. I was challenged by the question of how do we train up new application developers in two short years so they are prepared to land a tech job. With the low employment rate of two.year IT graduates issue set aside, how could I help DMACC align their Application Development program with industry readiness? Over the next year I met with every employer in the Des Moines. What I found was unsurprisingly tragic. No matter the employer and no matter the higher education Institution new grads were only twenty percent ready to develop software. Whether new grads had a DMACC, Iowa, Iowa State, Purdue or Notre Dame degree they were ill prepared to build mission-Critical applications. I had often mused that everyone I hired had to be trained and even untrained after their academic preparation. I and my colleagues have accepted this as a norm for our industry. What if lawyers, doctors, accountants, and engineers were only twenty percent ready to provide real-world value? Would we continue paying for this education and hiring them to affect real people's lives? The average four degree costs about ninty.thousand dollars while the average two-year degree costs fourteen-thousand dollars. High demand within our industry has blinded us from asking why we are investing so much just turn around and retrain our work force.

When we are forced to face this question we will realize that this is a- part problem. First technology is a moving target that is outpacing our ability to learn and adapt. Thomas Friedman illustrates this rate of change acceleration. (insert graph). LinkedIn 2017 Workplace Learning Report echos this gap stating that tech skills have a limited shelf.life. Within fire short years your skill relevance is out of date. As software professionals we've come to expect that we must be continuous learners to remain relevant. This rapid learning is reflected in popular books like Seven languages in Seven weeks. The tragic paradox is that the skills learned in n four year degree are out. of-date by the time graduates land their first job. That's assuming the applied skills were even aligned with the rapidly Changing languages, tools, fane works and techniques within our
industry. Tragically cirricnlum boards, department heads and professors are ill equipped to remain relevant in beyond fundamental concepts. This partially accounts for the dismal twenty-percent industry readiness of new graduates.

Secondly, full.stack, enterprise development requires a deep alphabet soup of technologies that is significantly different within each employer. As Z met with every employer throughout the Des Moines Area I built out a skill demand radar. This initial local sampling surfaced close to five-hundred technology skills required to build full-stack applications. While this spanned numerous languages and frameworks it painted a daunting picture as our Subcommittee attempted to help DMACC prepare their students for our industry. Even after filtering down to the top most in-demand local Skills it encompassed skills in which some skills I could not claim mastery even after nearly two-decade ds of building solutions. The sheer breadth of Knowledge could not be sufficiently taught in four years, let alone in two. One slice of value in an enterprise application almost always spans a half a dozen technologies. I remember looking at my first application developer job desription and wondering how I could ever learn the laundry list of skills. Many of the acronyms and criptic names I hadn't even heard of.

Third, Courses and tutorials rarely put these technologies together in a real-world application. While students may have a broad understanding of a smorgns board of topics they are ill equipped to build a valuable solution.
