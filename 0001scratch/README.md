# Scratch

## Introduction
Most programming languages used by start-ups and companies are difficult to read and write for people getting started.  Scratch removes this barrier by using drag and drop building blocks to create applications. This section is focused on programming concepts without all of the cryptic syntax found in languages like Java, C#, Ruby, Python and JavaScript.

## First Program
1. Go to [https://scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu).
1. Click on the `TRY IT OUT ` button.
1. Work through the `Getting Started with Scratch` tutorial. Click the `BEGIN >` button when you are ready to start.

## Version Control
What is version control and why should I care?  
1. Backup: It's a powerful way to not loose your work.  
2. History: It keeps a history of the changes that you make to your work.
3. Teamwork: It allows multiple people on a team to work on the same thing without destroying each other's work.

Git is a popular version control system.  GitHub is a free online service that allows anyone to version thier work remotely and share it with team members.  For now we will just use GitHub directly but in later sections we will use Git directly.

## Assignments
All assignments will be distributed and turned in through GitHub.
